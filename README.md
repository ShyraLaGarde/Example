This is a sample readme file for the GitHub Repository. I'm Practicing Markdown.

## Hyperlink Sample 

We use original images that are **High spatial resolution images** they have alot of fine details. Images were collected by *A Nasa operation* [IceBridge](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/index.html)

## Image Sample

- Tile shaping is splitting a large image into multiple tiles consequetially creating multiple images. 
![Tiling provides a more correct prediction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92336161/144960048-9f877b71-e16e-4ad4-804e-3e084c7d58ef.png)
- When processing an image we dont train the whole image because we have limited data sources

1. IceBridge provides polar ice images to better connect and understand polar regions and the global climate system
2. Annually studied are the changes in thickness of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets.
